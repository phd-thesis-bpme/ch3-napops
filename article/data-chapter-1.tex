\chapter{Point count offsets for estimating population sizes of North American landbirds}

\section{Abstract}
Bird monitoring in North America over several decades has generated many open databases, housing millions of structured and semi-structured bird observations. These provide the opportunity to estimate bird densities and population sizes, once variation in factors such as underlying field methods, timing, land cover, proximity to roads, and uneven spatial coverage are accounted for. To facilitate that integration across databases, we introduce NA-POPS: Point Count Offsets for Population Sizes of North American Landbirds. NA-POPS is a large-scale, multi-agency project providing an open-source database of detectability functions for all North American landbirds. These detectability functions allow the integration of data from across disparate survey methods using the QPAD approach, which considers the probability of detection (q) and availability (p) of birds in relation to area (a) and density (d). To date, NA-POPS has compiled over 7.1 million data points spanning 292 projects from across North America, and produced detectability functions for 338 landbird species. Here, we describe the methods used to curate these data and generate these detectability functions, as well as the open-access nature of the resulting database. 

\section{Introduction}
\par The broad scale monitoring of birds in North America over the past several decades has resulted in the availability of millions of bird observations in open databases that span most of the continent. Individual programs such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS \citep{hudson_role_2017, sauer_first_2017}), the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR \citep{pavlacky_statistically_2017}), the Boreal Avian Modelling Project (BAM \citep{cumming_toward_2010}), and eBird \citep{sullivan_ebird_2014} provide a great deal of information on relative abundance over time and space. Partners in Flight (PIF) has previously estimated population sizes of landbirds using BBS data and a series of sophisticated expert-informed equations to extrapolate survey-level counts to total abundance within defined geographic regions \citep{rosenberg_setting_2005, will_handbook_2020}. These population sizes have been used to inform reports such as the 2019 State of Canada’s Birds report \citep{north_american_bird_conservation_initiative_canada_state_2019}, and to show the loss of nearly 3 billion North American birds since the 1970s \citep{rosenberg_decline_2019}.

\par An estimate of detectability is needed to translate survey-level counts into estimates of total abundance \citep{rosenberg_setting_2005, stanton_estimating_2019}. For a bird, the overall probability of detection (i.e., its detectability) can be broken down into two independent probabilities: availability and perceptibility \citep{marsh_correcting_1989, johnson_defense_2008}. Availability is defined as the probability of a bird giving a cue (auditory or visual) during a survey. This probability is a function of a bird’s cue rate, defined as the expected number of cues per unit time, and can be calculated using surveys that employ removal sampling \citep{barker_statistical_1995, farnsworth_removal_2002, alldredge_time--detection_2007}. Perceptibility is defined as the probability of an observer detecting a cue from a bird, provided the bird is actually giving a cue. This probability is a function of the bird’s effective detection radius (EDR), defined as the distance at which the same number of birds go detected and undetected, and can be calculated using data from surveys that employ distance sampling \citep{buckland_introduction_2001, buckland_distance_2015}.

\subsection{The QPAD Approach to Detectability Estimation}
\par Detectability in landbirds is generally non-constant. Factors such as time of day, time of year, habitat type, and presence of roads, among several other factors, have been shown to affect both the availability and the perceptibility of birds \citep{wilson_reliability_1985, solymos_calibrating_2013, johnston_species_2014, cooke_road_2020}. Additionally, the length of time for which an observer surveys for a bird, and the maximum survey distance for which the observer is surveying, can account for some variation in how many birds are detected and recorded for any given survey \citep{alldredge_factors_2007, solymos_calibrating_2013, buckland_distance_2015}.  

\par The QPAD method developed by BAM is a flexible approach to accounting for heterogeneity in survey conditions and survey methodology \citep{solymos_calibrating_2013}. It can calculate availability and perceptibility independently, while allowing for multiple surveying methods to be accounted for at once. In other words, any dataset that employs a removal sampling approach with two or more time bins can be jointly used to calculate availability, and any dataset that employs a distance sampling approach with two or more distance bins can be jointly used to calculate perceptibility (Sólymos et al. 2013). Additionally, by recognizing that availability is a function of cue rate, and that perceptibility is a function of EDR, the QPAD method allows for variation in cue rate and EDR as a function of covariates that affect detectability (such as time of day, time of year, habitat type, roadsides, etc.), and for estimates of perceptibility as a function of survey radius or other covariates (Sólymos et al. 2013). 

\par In general, at any given sampling event, for species $s$, there exists the true species abundance $Y_s$, which represents all the individuals of species $s$ at that site at the time of the sampling event. During any sampling event, the recorded count for species $s$ (i.e., $\hat{Y_s}$), is a subset of the true abundance $Y_s$, such that $\hat{Y_s} \leq Y_s$, assuming individuals are correctly identified \citep{bennett_how_nodate, johnson_defense_2008}. The difference between the recorded count and the true count depends on the detectability of the birds. The factors that affect detectability of species $s$ can be accounted for in the latent detectability function $f(\cdot)$, such that
\begin{equation}\label{detect-function}
	\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{Y_s}\right] = Y_s \times f(\cdot).
\end{equation}

\par Let $p_s(t)$ be the availability of species $s$ for a given survey duration $t$, and let $q_s(r)$ be the perceptibility of species $s$ for a given survey radius $r$ from an observer \citep{solymos_calibrating_2013}. The detectability function can now be written as $f(\cdot) = p_s(t) \times q_s(r)$, and Equation \ref{detect-function} can now be written as:

\begin{equation*}
	\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{Y_s}\right] = Y_s \times p_s(t) \times q_s(r).
\end{equation*}

\par $p_s$ is calculated from surveys that employ a removal sampling approach \citep{alldredge_time--detection_2007, farnsworth_removal_2002, solymos_evaluating_2018}, in which total survey time is partitioned into “time bins” $t_J$, not necessarily of equal size. For example, a 6-minute survey may be partitioned into $J = 6$ 1-minute time bins. Or, it could be partitioned into a 1-minute time bin, followed by a 3-minute time bin, followed by a 2-minute time bin, for a total of $J = 3$ time bands. If a bird gives a cue and is recorded in time bin $j$, then it is “removed” from the available birds to be recorded in all subsequent time bin. Cue rates follow a Poisson process with Poisson parameter $\phi$, which is estimated via multinomial conditional maximum likelihood estimation given survey type and any number of covariates, and the time to first cue event (i.e., detection) follows an exponential distribution $f(t) = \phi e^{-t\phi}$. Thus, the cumulative distribution function for time to first detection on the interval $\left[0, t_J\right]$ is given by (Alldredge et al., 2007)
\begin{align*}
	p(t_J) &= \int_{0}^{t_J} \phi e^{-t\phi} dt \\
	&= 1 - e^{-t\phi}.
\end{align*}

\par $q_s$ is calculated from surveys employing a distance sampling protocol \citep{buckland_introduction_2001, buckland_distance_2015}. Distance sampling partitions the point count survey area into discrete distance bins $r_K$. For example, when considering a 200m point count radius, the area may be partitioned into $K = 2$ 100m bins, or $K = 4$ 50m bins. The outermost bin can have finite or infinite truncation distance. Birds are then recorded by the observer as to how far away from the observer the bird was perceived. \citet{solymos_calibrating_2013} assume a half-normal detection function with probability of detecting an available bird at a distance $r$ from the observer is $g(r) = e^{-\dfrac{r^2}{\tau^2}}$, where $\tau^2$ is the variance of the unfolded normal distribution that describes the rate of distance decay and is estimated via multinomial conditional maximum likelihood estimation given survey type and any number of covariates. Following \citet{buckland_introduction_2001, solymos_calibrating_2013} the probability $q_s$ that an individual bird located within radius $r_K$ gives a cue that is perceived by an observer is given by
\begin{equation*}
	q(r_K) = \dfrac{\pi \tau^2 \left(1 - e^{-\dfrac{r^2}{\tau^2}}\right)}{\pi r^2_K}
\end{equation*}

\par Finally, the QPAD method allows for estimates of true density to be derived from any survey, by allowing the detectability function to act as a statistical offset to account for differences among survey types. An offset term is used in linear models to adjust the expected value with a known quantity. In our case the detectability function quantity is not known but estimated through QPAD. But as a result, the offsets allow all survey-observed counts to be translated into an estimate of true density. That is, by recognizing that $Y_s = D_s \times A$, where $D_s$ is the density of species $s$ and $A$ is the total area sampled at a point count, we can get that $\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{Y_s}\right] = D_s \times A \times p_s(t) \times q_s(r)$, which can be rearranged for density $D_s$. Note that through commutativity, we can rearrange these terms as $\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{Y_s}\right] = q_s(r) \times p_s(t) \times A \times D_s$, hence "QPAD" \citep{solymos_calibrating_2013}.

\subsection{The Need for a Systematic Estimate of Detectability}
\par The current PIF population size estimates use coarse binned estimates of detection distance for each landbird, and calculate uncertainty around the detection distance using a uniform distribution \citep{stanton_estimating_2019, will_handbook_2020}. However, the methods by which these binned estimates are determined are not consistent across species, and often rely only on expert opinion. There is therefore a need for a systematic approach to estimating these detection distances for all landbirds, while accounting for variation in environmental conditions and survey types \citep{stanton_estimating_2019, will_handbook_2020}. BAM has already made huge strides in accomplishing this, by first generating estimates of cue rate and EDR for 75 North American boreal birds \citep{solymos_calibrating_2013}, and then further extending that to cue rates of 151 boreal birds \citep{solymos_evaluating_2018}, each time using data harmonization techniques \citep{barker_ecological_2015} and the QPAD methodology \citep{solymos_calibrating_2013} to allow for multiple survey types and survey conditions to be accounted for. Additionally, QPAD offsets produced by BAM have been used extensively to adjust survey point count data to account for detectability \citep{hobson_long-term_2019, zlonis_burn_2019, knaggs_avian_2020, leston_quantifying_2020}, and to estimate population sizes and distribution of boreal birds \citep{crosby_differential_2019, solymos_lessons_2020}. Thus, the next frontier is to extend these methods developed by BAM and use the millions of rigorously collected bird observations and covariates (i.e., landcover and road networks) that are now available at a continental scale to derive detectability estimates for as many North American landbirds as possible.

We have therefore created the collaborative project NA-POPS: Point count Offsets for Population Sizes of North American Landbirds, to apply the QPAD approach developed by BAM to a compilation of point counts across North America. Our overarching goal is to generate an open-source database of detectability functions, thus creating a systematic and standardized approach to generating detectability estimates across North American landbird species. NA-POPS includes a GitHub organization \citep{blischak_quick_2016, crystal-ornelas_not_2022} to securely store the databases, a series of fitted models to estimate cue rates and EDRs in common observation conditions, and an R-package for users to access the estimates. Here, we detail the methods surrounding the following key components of achieving this large-scale project: 1) data acquisition and standardization, 2) derivation of covariates and modelling of cue rate and EDR, and 3) the software infrastructure used to curate the data, generate model runs, and host results. We summarize the results of the data collection and modelling efforts, and highlight and example of species-specific results of American Robin \textit{Turdus migratorius}, a suitable species for a case study as it is a wide-ranging North American landbird well-covered in the NA-POPS database. Finally, we discuss some applications for these detectability offsets, and invite further data contributions to enable additional refinement of the offsets produced by NA-POPS.
